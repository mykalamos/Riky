<h1>Riky Choudhuri - North Indian Classical Bansuri Flute</h1>
<p>The paradox of Raga as both a restrictive and limitless aesthetic discipline neatly encapsulated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space ..."
  </p>
  <footer style="text-align:left">Hamlet Act x Scene y</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the creation of a tonal lattice based on a template yet subtly different on each rendering</p>
<p>On this site I have provided visualisations and flute minatures of a non-exhaustive list of North Indian Ragas
