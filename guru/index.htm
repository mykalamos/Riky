		<h1>Sri Clive Bell</h1>
		<h3>1939 - 2023</h3>
		<p>A legend of the bansuri in the UK, Guruji was born in Imperial Japan spending his formative years in the Asia Pacific region before coming to Europe in the 1960s.</p>
		<p>After visits to India in the 1970s to learn from, amongst others, Pt Ragunath Seth he left a career in television to pursue Indian Classical music full time. He taught for over 40 years in London as well as being a versatile performer and recording artist.</p>
	
		<p>Clive-ji developed a delicate playing style with sensitive Raga interpretation as its prime objective. In his teaching, scientific rigour cultivated artistic spontaneity.</p>
		<p>As a man he was erudite, gentle in demeanour, incisively humourous, and generous with his time and knowledge.</p>
