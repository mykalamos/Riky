		<h1>Sri Clive Bell</h1>
		<h2>1939 - 2023</h2>
		<p>A legend of the bansuri in the UK, Guruji was born in Imperial Japan spending his formative years in the Asia Pacific region before coming to Europe in the 1960s.</p>
		<p>After visits to India in the 1970s to learn from, amongst others, Pt Ragunath Seth he left a career in television to pursue Indian Classical music full time. He taught for over 40 years in London as well as being a versatile performer and recording artist.</p>
		<p>Clive-ji developed a delicate playing style with sensitive Raga interpretation its prime objective. In his teaching, scientific rigour was employed to cultivate artistic spontaneity.</p>
		<p>As a man he was erudite, gentle in demeanour, mischeivously witty, and very generous with his time for his students.</p>
