		<h1>Sri Clive Bell</h1>
		<h2>1939 - 2023</h2>
		<p>A legend of the bansuri in the UK, Guruji was born in Imperial Japan spending his formative years in the Asia Pacific region before coming to Europe in the 1960s</p>
		<p>After visits to India in the 1970s to learn from amongst others Pt Ragunath Seth he left a career in television to pursue Indian Classical music full time</p>
		<p>There then followed 40+ years of a life of teaching in London and a versatile performing and recording career</p>
		<p>Clive-ji developed a uniquely delicate ornamented playing style with sensitive Raga interpretation its prime objective</p>
		<p>He employed a scientific rigour to his teaching writing voluminous notes for his students incuding a treatise on Tihais but all in the service of the spontaneity of the art</p>
		<p>As a man he was endowed with a gentle modest demeanour, a mischeivous wit, generous with his time for his students, and possessed of an extensive knowledge of art, literature and other music. He is greatly missed</p>
