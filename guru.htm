		<h1>Sri Clive Bell</h1>
		<h2>1939 - 2023</h2>
		<p>A legend of the bansuri in the UK, Guruji was born in Imperial Japan spending his formative years in the Asia Pacific region before coming to Europe in the 1960s</p>
		<p>After visits to India in the 1970s to learn from amongst others Pt Ragunath Seth he left a career in television to pursue Indian Classical Music full time</p>
		<p>There then followed 40+ years of a life of teaching and performing sadly ended by cancer</p>
		<p>Clive-ji developed a uniquely delicate ornamented style with Raga interpretation at its core</p>
		<p>He employed a scientific rigour to his teaching writing voluminous notes for his students incuding a treatise on tihais but all in the service of the spontaneity of the art</p>
		<p>As a non-Indian coming to the music at a relatively late age his achievements were even more remarkable</p>
		<h2>Special Thanks To</h2>
